## Framework7 and Parse

> *Note: this is an old, not maintained project and the frameworks used in it have changed since. We decided to still leave this project on GitHub as a reference for multiple tutorials which were based on this code repositary. You have been warned.* 


This repository holds an example web application built with [Framework7](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/#.VSRQUovF87Y) mobile web framework and powered by [Parse.com](https://www.parse.com) for user account data storage.

Application implements user registration and user login funcionality.

You can find step by step tutorial about creating this mobile web application on [Htmlcenter](https://www.htmlcenter.com/blog/html5-frameworks-for-mobile-web-applications/). It describes how I have built this source code from ground up.
